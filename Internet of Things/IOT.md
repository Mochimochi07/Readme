#Internet of Things

This is my Internet of things Repository.
IOT referes to which refers to the network of physical devices that are embedded with modifications which enabling them to collect and exchange data.
The idea behind IoT is to connect these "things" to the internet.
The things reffered are the objects that can be modified in order to improve efficiency, productivity, and convenience.

If you see people with IOT in them they are not self proclaimed but self trained.
There are tons of misunderstanding in here like self proclaimation,the sensoring and other stuff.
