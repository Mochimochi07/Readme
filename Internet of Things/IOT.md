#Internet of Things

This is my Internet of things Repository.
IOT referes to which refers to the network of physical devices that are embedded with modifications which enabling them to collect and exchange data.
The idea behind IoT is to connect these "things" to the internet.
The things reffered are the objects that can be modified in order to improve efficiency, productivity, and convenience.

If you see people with IOT in them they are not self proclaimed but self trained.
There are tons of misunderstanding in here like self proclaimation, the sensoring and other stuff.

The self proclamation vs self trained in IOT is not really a thing here but the thing is IOT needs to have a strong desire for the future.
Yeah, i had 10 years of experience in business and less experience in other stuff so i say that i am eligible for IOT.
I also have other people who trains me well but i sometimes lack the time to do things efficiently because of burnouts.
The strong desire must be in that spot because its really IOT.
The desire for improvement and the desire to be better everyday.

The true meaning of IOT is the connection of the things for improvement.
And not the other way around which is giving things sensors and other stuff.
Putting Sensors in things are in the field of Robotics.
Well, im not putting Robotics off but Robotics should not be the main thing for IOT.
It should always be Data.
Yeah, its kinda more like the Tesla's AC and Edison's DC where every current is connected wired or wireless.
In terms of IOT, this can be a huge advantage or disadvantage because of distribution of data.
Some transcations of IOT may be lowcost and some may be expensive.
and some uses may be dangerous while the other may be not.
