This is my C# Read me.

I chose C# because it was challenging and simple to use.
I just like the syntax and Its more like a game development language actually.
I feel the power when i was coding with it but i always feel that it lacks something.
I chose this to learn GUI before heading for PyQt5 in Python.
The IDE is a little headache when it comes to storage.
I loved this but i want to know more techniques in order to use it.
C# and Java were my best choice because of OOP.
Both C# and Java are Powerful and I dont think that i have the wisdom to use it for my curiosity.
I want to pair this with Xojo because of the tons of advantages that i can make with it.
