#This is Faqs

•What is Dajtech?

>Dajtech is my own technology along with oyher tecchnologies existing.
It is not a company or a business. Its how i make things better. 
I meant its more of an upgrading type of technology where i use present,past and future resources.
It goes along in time and with time so naming it as a technology would count.
It was named "MAJAD" before but i changed it.
I changed it because it might be targeted by Konami becaause i named it after "palladium oracle mahad"
knowing that its just DAJ in backwards and the AM is the auto upgrade mechanism.
I was going to name it AJT reference after Taj mahal but its not much a goodname.
I found it before and i planned of using it in the future and for the future.
I kinda designed some of it after i made the project Incert.
Yes, because Sen. Miriam really gave me a positive impact in developing this technology (inspiration btw).
Its still not finished yet because i want to use it for IOT, masters degree and doctorate.
I wont say how this works because thats really inapropriate and confidential.

•How many programming language do you know?

>I learned Java,C#,Python,C,C++,Cobol,Javascript,Golang and Xojo.
I mainly learn and use atleast one static and dynamic programming language.
i use those things for studies so that i can study more app because the resources needed to learn varies in different languages.
Golangg and javascript for webdev,  C++ for embedded, Java and python(kivy) for mobile, C# andd Xojo for IOT.
yeah, its kinda hard having to learn them because theres alot to learn in order for me to go for IOT.
I dont use python anymore butt i mightt consider learning Datascience again.
Im not here to flex them but i have a habit of Gathering tons of resources for specific apps.. 
Yup, i just like learning while using the resources.
I currently learn and study C++ and javascript for learning thinngs in web  and embedded.
I might learn React for web and Reactnative for mobile apps.
I learn physics everyday using C++ because it has a huge component to IOT and modernization.
Learning Physics is highly beneficial because we know how to make things done using proper calculations.
Well lets just say that when we learn physics we will understand the principles of how thinngs work around us.

•Are there other programming languages?

>Well, there are tons of programming languages i currently learn i and i recently acquired old books about it like assembly,clipper,etc.
you cant see it here by the way.
Just data privacy. 
the ideas in here came from my curiosity while i do my thing through hardwork. 

•How did you made your username?

>I used my own childhood favorite food. 
I know mochi is a japanese rice cake and i do know in my stomach that i want to try some of those in the future.
i just like rice cakes and i found about Charlotte Katakuri in One Piece.
Yeah, the one that can see through the future and has rice cake power.
i just saw that we were quite similar since he has a big mouth and he also likes donuts.
not to mention katakuri can easily win eating contests through the use of his big mouth.
i also won before through the use of some techniques.
thats just how i made it.

•How are you able to generate questions that?

>I had personal abilities,skills and techniques that i didnt put in my resume.
not because of bragging or anything but its kinda more of a concious thing where i would still need to control and master those things.
I made techniques for my studies knowing that things will go really hard.
i still go with it even though the odds are not really mine.
its stressful to use those really but its beneficial for me to use them.
I cant tell much about those things now but i might put it up in the future.
its kinda better to me just to use proper energy management since work will be stressful.
im currently not taking my master's because i need so many things so that i can be accepted in a master's program.

•Why did you come back?
>I took a break. pardon but i had a laptop full of virus so i have tto make a clean for it.
I have an intel i2 laptop so its not good to have tons of virus in there. 
i almost made a mistake to make the files disappear.
I want to take this time to set thing bacck to where it belongs.

•Why do you call yourself Futuristic Developer? is Futuristic a programming language?
>I am highly futuristic because i always think clearly about my next step. As a futuristic person i do not like to be-
Involved in politics and modernity things(lgbtq,equality,etc).
Well i do have some ideologies, faith, things, aand other thinngs in those areas but i prefer to make a good thing for the next generation.
I made a choice to make it better but i kinnda have to sacrifice my sanity and heart for that.

•Tell me some techniques of yours.
>Sincerely i havee tons of them.
Im just going to expose one skill.
Well a good thing for people is my forensic skill.
Forensics? 
Yes! Cybersecurity might be gone in the future so forensics would be a good thing to have wwhen IOT commes out.
I mean no more cyberbullying, no more alters in twitter, no more human trafficking,etc.
BUT physical objects where you can be connected in the internet easily wherever you go might scare people out.
so in that case people will just try to come and hurt others physically.
Like getting peoples fingers cut inorder to use the biometric system to open locks.
The example that i was thinking is just connecting things.
To do it is just control your anxiety.
I know its ironic to hear that because anxiety cannot bbe controlled but it needs curiosity to control that.
I meaan if you ever have a feeling to talk to a stranger or do somethinng that you miggt need to have.
Its one of my skill to know what to do next.
Forensics is a good to have in Developing apps because i would have a good taste on what clients need.
And not just that it helps me read codes much easier and faster because of Architecture and cryptography.
People go for architecture because it literally says everything about the worrkflow.
An example is this.
the problem is international police sometimes uses drugs and somme dogs to implant illegal things.
so having a hidden camera in the vehicle connected to the internet  would be a good thing to have.
to have a support foor that. i designed some stations where peeople would login to locations with their cards intact.
This is just effective for other countries though.
effective to have backup plans.
Since people are having a big deal on police and racism.
i know that i dont have designing skills but im still worrking on it.
But i do want to be called Dr. Detective Boss A.J. with a P.H.D Andd M.D.
that would be hard and awesome at the same time to fill out my own papers.
Doctor forr my acads, detective for making IOT while making deductions, andd Boss because im gonna make tons of business.

•How about your belief?
>People would call me a templar but im a Nazarite. 
They're uncomfortablle because of my extreme belief in things.
Ever heard of Samson and Delilah? yeah, that but im still a christian even without the vow.
I customized my vow so me and other people couldnt destroy it easily.
Time and Spirit are my friend so its a good thing that theyre around.

•What Type of programming language do you use mainly.
> I mainly use Golang for static and Now im learning PHP for dynamic.
its kinda good to have golang for microservices andd backend development.
The idea of having simplicity in your mode of learning is good to have so that It would bbe easy to make and easy to understand.
The good thing about using frameworks is the fast learning experience to have a faster deployment of those apps.
You know what they say. "The simple the programs the more experienced the programmer should be."
Its a good thing i learned Golang because I like makinng thoose backend systems fast.
