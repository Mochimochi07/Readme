#This is Faqs

•What is Dajtech?

>>Dajtech is my own technology along with oyher tecchnologies existing.
It is not a company or a business. Its how i make things better. 
I meant its more of an upgrading type of technology where i use present,past and future resources.
It goes along in time and with time so naming it as a technology would count.
It was named "MAJAD" before but i changed it.
I changed it because it might be targeted by Konami becaause i named it after "palladium oracle mahad"
knowing that its just DAJ in backwards and the AM is the auto upgrade mechanism.
I was going to name it AJT reference after Taj mahal but its not much a goodname.
I found it before and i planned of using it in the future and for the future.
I kinda designed some of it after i made the project Incert.
Yes, because Sen. Miriam really gave me a positive impact in developing this technology (inspiration btw).
Its still not finished yet because i want to use it for IOT, masters degree and doctorate.
I wont say how this works because thats really inapropriate and confidential.

•How many programming language do you know?

>>I learned Java,C#,Python,C,C++,Cobol,Javascript,Golang and Xojo.
I mainly learn and use atleast one static and dynamic programming language.
i use those things for studies so that i can study more app because the resources needed to learn varies in different languages.
Golangg and javascript for webdev,  C++ for embedded, Java and python(kivy) for mobile, C# andd Xojo for IOT.
yeah, its kinda hard having to learn them because theres alot to learn in order for me to go for IOT.
I dont use python anymore butt i mightt consider learning Datascience again.
I currently learn and study C++ and javascript for learning thinngs in web  and embedded.
I might learn React for web and Reactnative for mobile apps.
I learn physics everyday using C++ because it has a huge component to IOT and modernization.
Learning Physics is highly beneficial because we know how to make things done using proper calculations.
Well lets just say that when we learn physics we will understand the principles of how thinngs work around us.
