# Readme
A Read Me file for the entire repo


I changed the directory of the readme to make it organized.

Yeah, if people are wondering.
Why is my read me like that?
In the previous decades im just fond of using application Cracks.
i mean the read me cracks.
Well when i was a kid i always download apps in  the net.
yeah, Both fake games, romhack games, free apps with no virus, and others.
its kinda slow downloading in utorrent.
that thing reminds me of golang concurrency again.
within the downloaded files im always happy seeing Large letters in cracks.
large letters in readmes are cool to use.
that gives me nostalgic feeling of playing old games like stronghold crusader,warcraft3,etc.
making a little oldie readme design would give me a boost in coding.
