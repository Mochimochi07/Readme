# Readme
The Main Read Me file for the entire repo

This is a must read if you want to use one of my repositories.
You can see that some of my repos have no packages and modules.
I usually post my codes incompletely so that people would know how to use and handle servers first before using

I will be connecting my website to github soon.
I would also include some Kaggle stuff to site along with the notebooks only using Golang as a language.
Well I might add some things like Xojo apps for Dashboards and other data science stuff.
I don't use python anymore but i might include my past apps that i made before when learning to make apps.

My Techniques, Notebooks, Application architecture, and other IOT are not here but these will be posted on my website in the future.
More Apps, Notebooks and Tools to be posted after the connection so stay tuned at March.

Note: I will be posting only Xojo pics of my own dashboards, tools and apps.
