# Readme
The Main Read Me file for the entire repo

This is a must read if you want to use one of my repositories.
You can see that some of my repos have no packages and modules.
I usually post my codes incompletely so that people would know how to use and handle servers first before using

I will be connecting my website to github soon.
I would also include some Kaggle stuff to site along with the notebooks only using Golang as a language.
Well I might add some things like Xojo apps for Dashboards and other data science stuff.
I don't use python anymore but i might include my past apps that i made before when learning to make apps.

There's no game development here because i focus mainly on the big three in companies.
the big three is Data Science, Software Development and Cyber Security.
Well I might consider making games but i would prioritize it for last.
I wouldd prefer Golang first for software programminng because i will be using Xojo for IOT.
Yes, I found two of my ideal programming language but i still have to get one more because i am finding atleast three for getting into the big three.

My Techniques, Notebooks, Application architecture, and other IOT are not here but these will be posted on my website in the future.
More Apps, Notebooks and Tools to be posted after the connection so stay tuned at March.

Note: In terms of Xojo programming, I will be posting only pics of my own dashboards, tools and apps. Because Xojo is used within an IDE and the IDE makes it all in one place including the Webframework.
