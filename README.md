# Readme
The Main Read Me file for the entire repo

++++++++++++ 1

This is a must read if you want to use one of my repositories.
You can see that some of my repos have no packages and modules.
I usually post my codes incompletely so that people would know how to use and handle servers first before using

++++++++++++ 2

I will be connecting my website to github soon.
I would also include some Kaggle stuff to site along with the notebooks only using Golang as a language.
Well I might add some things like Xojo apps for Dashboards and other data science stuff.
I don't use python anymore but i might include my past apps that i made before when learning to make apps.

++++++++++++ 3

There's no game development here because i focus mainly on the big three in companies.
the big three is Data Science, Software Development and Cyber Security.
Well I might consider making games but i would prioritize it for last.
I wouldd prefer Golang first for software programminng because i will be using Xojo for IOT.
Yes, I found two of my ideal programming language but i still have to get one more because i am finding atleast three for getting into the big three.

++++++++++++ 4

The two of my ideal programming language are xojo and C# because if i would be in a programming certification test i would be using those for making GUI easier.
But i do need more time to learn web services first that's why i went to Golang and Javascript.
Javascript for front end and Golang for backend. 
I know C# is fast and powerful because i saw the web benchmarks but i cant handle those things without gettting the basics of handling servers.
Well, what about concurrency? CMS? CDN? usage of static files? the tokens like jwt or others?
Thats what im talking about getting much resources first before i go on getting C# and Xojo.
Xojo is more advanced like VBA and C# is powerful and on par with Java.
I didnt use xojo and C# because i dont have funds to go get more sources.
In Xojo its kinda better if i would have xojo license because of the auto build feature for building with multiple OS.
Like i would build in Windows and the feature just builds the same app for other OS like IOS.

++++++++++++ 5

I still haven't uploaded some of the competitive programming because i still need some sources on making those things. 
I was kinda thinking of physics but competitions are always based on statistics and algorithms.
I still think of games because games are just made of tons of statistics,data and functions.
It might be a little rough because im coaching and literally changing fate of those games which kinda takes the fun out of it.
It might take a while for me to get things running.
i still have to find some sources that i can use for programming.

++++++++++++ 6

I will be posting Competitive programs for 3 problems a day.
Fair enough for me to learn and improve. 
How about the repos?
Ill just say that for every 6 problems I make a new repository for systems or web.
if problem%6==0 then repo++.

I'll start sharing Github profile and repositories at March.

++++++++++++ 7

Hey, uh... I think i wont be in competitive programming anymore. 
I want to stop grinding for those solutions because its not what my curiosity wants.
So i concluded that I'll be posting a maximumof 5 in my competitive programming.
Honestly its not beneficial to learn it.
Lets just say that the reality of that is just Simulating the problems in a computer.
the problems that data scientist and mathematicians can simulate witthin a short time.
That is the bad news.

The good news is that I still have that competitiveness but its for Hackathon only.
Yes, only for generating good apps because thats what i feel like doing.
Like my fave artist level in music but mine is just in apps andd modifications.
yeah, i also have that skill but in apps and i had trained for it long ago.
An example for that is how i can make apps with just a mug and a spoon.
I dont tap the mug with a spoon.
The modification of this is just art and physics.
You cant modify the mug because it will electrify the consumer but you can use the surroundings.
the spoon and the electric kettle can be modified into one.
where the electric kettle can have a drill effect with a dettacheable spoon upon it as a whisk.
And No..you dont beat eggs with it.
While you have a coffee powder in your mug you can just use the modified Kettle spoon as a kettle with a whisk.
Then there you go you just got yourself a coffee and a mug product.
Thats just for IOT and the app is the modified Kettle and spoon with arduino


++++++++++++ 8 

I have decided that i will not be making tons of readme files.
But i made a plan to make it more of a fullstack static design. 
I did that so it will be more Organized.
I want to see it more of an organized front end thing
because there are lots of repositories now.
I mean I want people to navigate my repositories through my overview.
Where my overview is the static text path for my codes.

++++++++++++ 9

I will be inserting some pictures to make it more understandable.
Its going to be a little weird and a little fun for the moment.
Its going to take a little time for me to have some cleaning.
February is near so i might need to do some literature for that.
I took off my music because i will be putting it somewhere.
yup, i just like learning things in secret places.


++++++++++++ 10

I took off some of the literatures and art. 
This is how i will learn React and i like it.
I love the way that it really goes connected to the way i want to express.
even though i would have a hard time on designing im still in the mood for doing things.
And i took off the datascience and cybersecurity.
I didnt took it off permanently because i just need to focus more on web dev for a moment.

++++++++++++ 11

I took off the other parts and focused more on big three of IT which kinda forms the IOT in software.
IOT also has the big three which are the software,hardware and the technical part.
I already had some few experience and support for the technical part.
I use low level pcs and some low level things when i was trained about troubleshooting and other things before.
I just need to focus more on the big three in software so i decided to give more energy to it and less to other things.
i code using laptops and pcs which were literally repaired so having technical things learned is a boost.
Well, it does have some malfunctions all the time but it still performs good.
I do have a hard time with the fetching part of the front end so i might take little time learning with the static part.
Still need to configure the repos since i made a language categorized repos.
i might take the time from march to april.

++++++++++++ 12

I want a little more rest so i decided to go configure my repos for a while.
The challenge is not much cancelled but i'll put it up in my literature tab so its not a waste.
I put up the literature in Cybersecurity because there are many things that literataure can be used in that area.
Like sending a Mona Lisa pic with cryptography.
I dont play games anymore because i like making builds.
I may be off from coding for a while.

++++++++++++ 13

I added Cybersecurity but i only limited the repo for a maximum of 3 apps.
its kinda beneficial if people would just go training because they also get paid.
In terms of cyberforensics, you might not see some of these here.
I will be using some of those in IOT.
Yeah, its kind of useful in there.

++++++++++++ 14

I took off all the other business where i cant focus.
i replaced them for app dev as features so that it would be a waste again.
i needed to reuse tons of them for learning Appdev and IOT for the future.
I might need to take a little time to rest for myself.
I set up my wix and It might take me time to get the hang of this.

Wix took a little long to make my own front end and UI so i rather use my old Canva for that.
i still wanted to use wix but i need to focus more on the apps and how i implement them.
Im still active but i will not be coding at the moment.
Next time im going to try harder and generate x4 more effort.
yeah, i also have techniques for that.
in terms of coding, I might be back after a week.
