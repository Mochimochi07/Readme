# Readme
The Main Read Me file for the entire repo

++++++++++++ 1

This is a must read if you want to use one of my repositories.
You can see that some of my repos have no packages and modules.
I usually post my codes incompletely so that people would know how to use and handle servers first before using

++++++++++++ 2

I will be connecting my website to github soon.
I would also include some Kaggle stuff to site along with the notebooks only using Golang as a language.
Well I might add some things like Xojo apps for Dashboards and other data science stuff.
I don't use python anymore but i might include my past apps that i made before when learning to make apps.

++++++++++++ 3

There's no game development here because i focus mainly on the big three in companies.
the big three is Data Science, Software Development and Cyber Security.
Well I might consider making games but i would prioritize it for last.
I wouldd prefer Golang first for software programminng because i will be using Xojo for IOT.
Yes, I found two of my ideal programming language but i still have to get one more because i am finding atleast three for getting into the big three.

++++++++++++ 4

The two of my ideal programming language are xojo and C# because if i would be in a programming certification test i would be using those for making GUI easier.
But i do need more time to learn web services first that's why i went to Golang and Javascript.
Javascript for front end and Golang for backend. 
I know C# is fast and powerful because i saw the web benchmarks but i cant handle those things without gettting the basics of handling servers.
Well, what about concurrency? CMS? CDN? usage of static files? the tokens like jwt or others?
Thats what im talking about getting much resources first before i go on getting C# and Xojo.
Xojo is more advanced like VBA and C# is powerful and on par with Java.
I didnt use xojo and C# because i dont have funds to go get more sources.
In Xojo its kinda better if i would have xojo license because of the auto build feature for building with multiple OS.
Like i would build in Windows and the feature just builds the same app for other OS like IOS.

++++++++++++ 5

I still haven't uploaded some of the competitive programming because i still need some sources on making those things. 
I was kinda thinking of physics but competitions are always based on statistics and algorithms.
I still think of games because games are just made of tons of statistics,data and functions.
It might be a little rough because im coaching and literally changing fate of those games which kinda takes the fun out of it.
It might take a while for me to get things running.
i still have to find some sources that i can use for programming.

++++++++++++ 6

I will be posting Competitive programs for 3 problems a day.
Fair enough for me to learn and improve. 
How about the repos?
Ill just say that for every 6 problems I make a new repository for systems or web.
if problem%6==0 then repo++.

I'll start sharing Github profile and repositories at March.

++++++++++++ 7

Hey, uh... I think i wont be in competitive programming anymore. 
I want to stop grinding for those solutions because its not what my curiosity wants.
So i concluded that I'll be posting a maximumof 5 in my competitive programming.
Honestly its not beneficial to learn it.
Lets just say that the reality of that is just Simulating the problems in a computer.
the problems that data scientist and mathematicians can simulate witthin a short time.
That is the bad news.

The good news is that I still have that competitiveness but its for Hackathon only.
Yes, only for generating good apps because thats what i feel like doing.
Like my fave artist level in music but mine is just in apps andd modifications.
yeah, i also have that skill but in apps and i had trained for it long ago.
An example for that is how i can make apps with just a mug and a spoon.
I dont tap the mug with a spoon.
The modification of this is just art and physics.
You cant modify the mug because it will electrify the consumer but you can use the surroundings.
the spoon and the electric kettle can be modified into one.
where the electric kettle can have a drill effect with a dettacheable spoon upon it as a whisk.
And No..you dont beat eggs with it.
While you have a coffee powder in your mug you can just use the modified Kettle spoon as a kettle with a whisk.
Then there you go you just got yourself a coffee and a mug product.
Thats just for IOT and the app is the modified Kettle and spoon with arduino


++++++++++++ 8 

I have decided that i will not be making tons of readme files.
But i made a plan to make it more of a fullstack static design. 
I did that so it will be more Organized.
I want to see it more of an organized front end thing
because there are lots of repositories now.
I mean I want people to navigate my repositories through my overview.
Where my overview is the static text path for my codes.

++++++++++++ 9

I will be inserting some pictures to make it more understandable.
Its going to be a little weird and a little fun for the moment.
Its going to take a little time for me to have some cleaning.
February is near so i might need to do some literature for that.




++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

My Techniques, Notebooks, Application architecture, and other IOT are not here but these will be posted on my website in the future.
More Apps, Notebooks and Tools to be posted after the connection so stay tuned at March.



Note: In terms of Xojo programming, I will be posting only pics of my own dashboards, tools and apps. Because Xojo is used within an IDE and the IDE makes it all in one place including the Webframework.
