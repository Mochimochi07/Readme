This is my Javascript repository.

I pick Javascript the third programming language to learn
because i want to feel the wholeness of the application.
I meant feeling that fullstack programming in how things work.
I love the feeling of how connected i am to my work.
Javascript has a large developer community and I love that i have tons of sources.
The feeling of having tons of resources gives me more power to strive forward.
I know that it is a little messy language but it does give me a thrill.
