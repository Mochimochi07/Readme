#App Dev Repo

Hi, This is my App Dev repo.
This is the repo where I keep all my app dev systems.
Yeah, its hard to explain because i still need answer upon Linking things.
I just like upgrading and linking things to other things.
I usually dont build much but i do make up for it in the features sections.






Here are the routes.
