I went to make a little adjustment for data science.
Meh. 
I cant fit in data analyst role anymore.
I wanted to level up so ill just stay in either data engineer, business intelligence analyst and data architect role.
I mean its not hard to learn data science but its more of a computation part.
i just like gathering data and make conclusions so i'll just stick to either three of them.
I kinda need th data Science computational part for Physics.
Physics is a must for IOT but i kinda need more resources.
i just like the part where i dont use python.
i already had 4 years of it with slow growth and i just get stuck learning templates.
I might take a while to understand things.
I need to pick in either one of my top programming language for it.
But i did a little progress with it. 
I wanted to pursue some things from it.
Well i can do a some machine learning since i love robots, algorithms and game architecture.
Nah.
I might as well go back to machine learning.
Machine learning is advanced and being accepted without masters would be really hard

I just went back at some notes to learn Quantum mechanics.
Damn, that is weird and beutiful.
its going to be a good upgrade for my techy stuff.
I know its kinda confusing but i do love lasers and starwars.
Randomness is a sweet thing to know. 
It reminds me of spongebob literally  showing people what his random moves are.
i know spongebob is not quantum mechanics but i just like the randomness of art.
people dont know how i love probabilities. 
i just want to upgrade it.
yeah, like multiverse and quantum mmechanics they can only be measured through probab.
it kinda makes me undecisive a little.
Randomness and chaos are different terms by the way.
i think i had enough lasers, planning, probabilities and indecisiveness for now.

++++++++++++ 23

I kinda forgot what day it is learning quantum mechanics.
thats okay for me btw.
Now i do have tons of questions that i need to let out.
I really had a few before and now it increased.
it increased because of the probabilities must add up to 1.
Normalization condition i think heard of that before in my old school.
yeah it kinndaa states that all probab must be equal to one and makes it whole.
In my view i have an analogy for that.
Its like a crime scene where you deduce the crime while gather the evidence in order to glue the states must to add up to 1 as a whole.
the evidences are the possible states, while the individual probabilities that associates with the outcomes represent the likelihood of the system.
just as pieces of evidence can lead up to suspect or a scenario.
Its an interesting analogy but there are tons of differences within crime scene and quantum mech.
Fascinating but i need to take a nap because my head might explode.
Its kinda important to know much of these like the normalization condition and making a Metaphor from these because its confusing on how people will interpret.

++++++++++++ 24

Going back to Golang because my mind has expanded alot for IOT.
Quantum mech has similadities with Go but they are literally different.
like superposition,interference,non determinism and parallelism.
Mastering Go and xojo would be hard but its worth trying.
Its kinda more of thing where Jobs would likely require you to learn atleast one  Dynamic and static prog language.
Speed annd pperformance is a must in calculations.
Yeah i quit python because my curiosity left.
Well. gonna fork things as many as possible for Resource.

Just went for a little video marathon.
I wanted to find something more of a quirky thing.
something that may specialize some types of art.
I found something interesting before.
its more of a thing called "Art imitates life."
Its the idea that speaks to the powerful role that art can play in shaping our understanding of the world around us. 
which is helping us to explore and express the complex emotions, ideas, and experiences that make us human.
Its a good thing to learn more of art for IOT.
Cuz i really thought on going to a museum.
I dont have much experience with this but ill just try and see what happens.

Well i just need to relearn c++ again.
I dont want to use golang anymore.
I just see myself wanting to build things in Jupyter notebook.
Mostly other things for IOT.
I want to continue my physics study and go deeper.
Dont know how deep but ill just go in anyways.
I'll just find it out for myself.

The Golang setup took too long to update.
and the mingw for c++ took a me tons of time to configure.
Well. DataScience here we go again.

++++++++++++ 26

I made a little progress in the fundamentals.
i also had trouble using vscode c++ kernels.
cant use xeuscling ffor that so just stick with the notebook.
Okay then. will be taking a little rest and ill be back on track.

I might take a day or two to get rest.
Sometimes it doesnt stick outt to my head about IOT.
Since IOT is more about connectinng everything.
I might need a little time about thinking of little things.
Things like how to fix someone's refrigerator since its in my learning field.
well some people may or may not but going for IOT needs some little patience for that.

++++++++++++ 27

Another day of non coding.
Well, just researching.
I kinda want to take my old skill to the next level.
I always wanted to do massage therapy in my life.
I always did that when i was young.
Besides i have healing hands for that.
Well, people can say that metaphorically. 
It seems to me that ayurveda was a good practice for relaxation.
So physics and medicine as two primary sources for data science.
Thats kinda nice.

Im going to take my timw to get things in track.
Let's just say that im going off for a while.
Off because i'll configure stuff.
I had learned that its kinda possible for me to learn technology in other areas.
Just IOT stuff.
I am going to do things that i want to do.

++++++++++++ 28

I found my old books on math and Physics.
Well. might as well put that in my repos.
I wanna get more and more.
Well, more repositories to come. 
I have decided just to stick back to the basics.
I would want to relearn all of them while coding.
Well, I'll just request to get books from Doctors for myself.
Im really excited and i want to earn my masters and doctorate soon.
Well its kinnda hard to make apps for doctors since I need literal information for JSON.
I might begin coding soon.

Well, i just finished coding some physics parts.
I literally didnt know what i was calculating actually.
It was fun but i had to stop there because i frequently needed to answer some C++ exercises for fundamentals again.
I really want to do embedded now.
The Healthcare will be soon after i picked my framework.
And know how to fix the xeuscling for data science in this since im not going to use python for that

++++++++++++ 29

I uploaded just one and i might go back and do tons of exercises.
I need a calculator by the way.
Well, i can calculate in C++ but i might need to get it up in a paper first before doing it in a software.
I might need to limit becauuse the exercises are few but the chapters are a lot to take in.
Which kinnda means that theres a total of morethan 30 chaps so its a plus 30 repositories for me.
I'll see what happens next.

I got plenty of changes in the repository.
Some of those are the the fun programs.
I just need to remake it in C++ for embedded.
I just want to learn CLI for the moment to refresh my mind from making sites in GOlang.
I also changed the directory of the README.
I kinda like it. 
My repos just goes and multiplies.
Thats enough for today.
I'll limit the number of Physics by 5 exercise per section of exercise.

++++++++++++ 30

I had a good time earlier but i want to take this time to take a little break.
well, a break from some things because i just want to do something that i always wanted to do when i was a kid.
Its kinda personal and i dont like showing it.
That's sweet to remember.
Now i can do things that i really enjoy everyday.
i tried before but i made a mistake because i didnt have the skills to do it before.
Although i had forgotten about that because of multiple burnouts throughout the years.
I am happy that im doing it.
I may take time to rest and refrain from using github.
well, im going to post sometime.

I took the rest i needed.
Well, screw the few time for the resting part!
I'm going to be in IOT in the future by the way so.
LEZDUIT!

I still gonna have a little rest though.
meh, just wanna get confident and not depressed.
I still have thinngs to do.

++++++++++++ 31

Things go so fast.
I cant wait to show some percent of my skills.
Better to expect the worst now.
Well, lets find out.
