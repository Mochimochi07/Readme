++++++++++++ 21

I went to make a little adjustment for data science.
Meh. 
I cant fit in data analyst role anymore.
I wanted to level up so ill just stay in data engineer, business intelligence analyst and data architect role.
I mean its not hard to learn data science but its more of a computation part.
i just like gathering data and make conclusions so i'll just stick to either three of them.
I kinda need th data Science computational part for Physics.
Physics is a must but i kinda need more resources.
i just like the part where i dont use python.
