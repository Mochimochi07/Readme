I went to make a little adjustment for data science.
Meh. 
I cant fit in data analyst role anymore.
I wanted to level up so ill just stay in either data engineer, business intelligence analyst and data architect role.
I mean its not hard to learn data science but its more of a computation part.
i just like gathering data and make conclusions so i'll just stick to either three of them.
I kinda need th data Science computational part for Physics.
Physics is a must for IOT but i kinda need more resources.
i just like the part where i dont use python.
i already had 4 years of it with slow growth and i just get stuck learning templates.
I might take a while to understand things.
I need to pick in either one of my top programming language for it.
But i did a little progress with it. 
I wanted to pursue some things from it.
Well i can do a some machine learning since i love robots, algorithms and game architecture.
Nah.
I might as well go back to machine learning.
Machine learning is advanced and being accepted without masters would be really hard

I just went back at some notes to learn Quantum mechanics.
Damn, that is weird and beutiful.
its going to be a good upgrade for my techy stuff.
I know its kinda confusing but i do love lasers and starwars.
