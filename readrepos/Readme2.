I went to make a little adjustment for data science.
Meh. 
I cant fit in data analyst role anymore.
I wanted to level up so ill just stay in either data engineer, business intelligence analyst and data architect role.
I mean its not hard to learn data science but its more of a computation part.
i just like gathering data and make conclusions so i'll just stick to either three of them.
I kinda need th data Science computational part for Physics.
Physics is a must for IOT but i kinda need more resources.
i just like the part where i dont use python.
i already had 4 years of it with slow growth and i just get stuck learning templates.
I might take a while to understand things.
I need to pick in either one of my top programming language for it.
But i did a little progress with it. 
I wanted to pursue some things from it.
Well i can do a some machine learning since i love robots, algorithms and game architecture.
Nah.
I might as well go back to machine learning.
Machine learning is advanced and being accepted without masters would be really hard

I just went back at some notes to learn Quantum mechanics.
Damn, that is weird and beutiful.
its going to be a good upgrade for my techy stuff.
I know its kinda confusing but i do love lasers and starwars.
Randomness is a sweet thing to know. 
It reminds me of spongebob literally  showing people what his random moves are.
i know spongebob is not quantum mechanics but i just like the randomness of art.
people dont know how i love probabilities. 
i just want to upgrade it.
yeah, like multiverse and quantum mmechanics they can only be measured through probab.
it kinda makes me undecisive a little.
Randomness and chaos are different terms by the way.
i think i had enough lasers, planning, probabilities and indecisiveness for now.

I kinda forgot what day it is learning quantum mechanics.
thats okay for me btw.
Now i do have tons of questions that i need to let out.
I really had a few before and now it increased.
it increased because of the probabilities must add up to 1.
Normalization condition i think heard of that before in my old school.
yeah it kinndaa states that all probab must be equal to one and makes it whole.
In my view i have an analogy for that.
Its like a crime scene where you deduce the crime while gather the evidence in order to glue the states must to add up to 1 as a whole.
the evidences are the possible states, while the individual probabilities that associates with the outcomes represent the likelihood of the system.
just as pieces of evidence can lead up to suspect or a scenario.
Its an interesting analogy but there are tons of differences within crime scene and quantum mech.
Fascinating but i need to take a nap because my head might explode.
