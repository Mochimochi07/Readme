#Cybersecurity Repo.

This is my Cybersecurity Repo.
Well this is more about security and data.
But i provided a little spice by using art and literature within it.
I know that its a good way to tackle emotions while learning.
I also tackled it with some Cyberforensics so that it would be a little fun.
Where is art in data protection?
Thats a good question.
Art in data protection lives within digital security for data stored in databases.
Like Mysterio's BARF technology, it lives to amuse and protect the data in various ways.
