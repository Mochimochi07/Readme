This is my golang Repo.

This will be the last time that i will make a custom repo.

I chose Golang because of its simplicity.

It has simple syntax and its also an upgraded C language.

Yes, because in C language theres no dictionary so you're going to have a hard time making your own syntax in that.

I wanted to try working in Google or anywhere in FAANG.

So sad that Go doesnt have any UI library but it has some potential in web developmen.

Even though its a young language it can be a huge advantage learning other functions for learning web dev.

Learning Go was a best choice before Xojo with C# and Javascript.

I learned GUI first when i was still learning programming and i didnt know much about making other products.
