#PhysicsRepo.

This is my Physics Repo.

Physics is a must learn for IOT.
I want to learn Physics in the mean time even if im still not in masters or doctorate.
Computational Physics is mu own field because its the nearest path to my own career.
I saw that physics has tons of resources so i might upload tons of different apps here.
Its random so it woulld be fun to make a lot of ideas.

still got other things to do.
I might add more apps in the future.
